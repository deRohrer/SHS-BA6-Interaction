# Edge of the Universe
 This repository documents the making and results of an interactive story made through unity. This is part of an the SHS course "Pratiques Artistiques: Interaction" by a group consisting of three students.

# Development process

## 1. Inspiration
A first inpiration for what the story should look like was obtained from pulling random cards for the topics
* Interaction
* Mechanism
* Obstacle
* Motivation
* Bonus

## 2. Storyboard
Based on these notions, but allowing ourselfs to add others and ignore some we came up with a storyboard.

Our game would follow an alien that got sucked in by a black hole and shot out onto a distant planet at the edge of the universe. To get home it has to explore the planet and travel to neighbouring worlds and find the parts of its spaceship that broke in the black hole. You do this by interacting with the inhabitants and environment of the planets. At the risk of creating some chaos, getting lost or making friends.

## 3. Paper Prototype
To test if the imagined implementations made sense, we first made a prototype using paper and cardboard to make a few scenes.

In the this protoype we tested two quests. In the first you return an egg to its nest which makes the alien bird mother gift you a spaceship part. In a second task another planet inhabitant gives you a piece after you return something to it, that you think might belong to it...
We also tested traveling from planet to planet.

## 4. Development in Unity
Unity: (<href src=https://unity.com/download>https://unity.com/download</href>)

After fixing some ideas from the prototype, the actual development started. This included:
* Visual asset design
* Music
* Coding
* Version control using GitHub
(Since all of the team members had none/little coding experience, the final product so far might seem relatively small. Further ideas can be found in the **Further Steps** section below.)

# Further Steps
The following shows a list of missions not implemented so far.

#### Planet 1

* Sad flower, you see a watering can. You water the flower. Happy flower.
* You spot a paint bucket.
* The same level with the egg but this time when you return it a little monster hatches and eats the bird creature.
* Pull at a worm sticking out of the ground. It is actually the tentacle on the head of a snobby looking mole alien (maybe in a suit and bowler hat) you just disturbed from sleep and that now starts yelling $!#‚Äù%.
* This is the code for a vault with a rocket ship peace inside somewhere (maybe on another planet).

#### Planet 2

* A dog is looking for a stick to fetch, when you see a stick in the distance, you go pull it out of the ground, but a big crack appears, destabilizing the planet!
* A creature is holding a big brush to paint his house, but can no longer find his paint bucket! You go back to planet 1 to get the paint you spotted.
* There is a gardeners market stand with a sign which says that for a certain flower you can get a watering can. With it you can water a sad looking raincloud which takes of afterwards. It produces lightning you need to power a spaceship piece (battery that it gave you before maybe?

#### Planet 3

* Meet cute looking ducky in a pond, ask you find some food. You go find something for it (maybe a bag that says duck food on it lol) and when you go feed the duck it turns into a monster duck and eats surrounding plant/animals. Oops!
* There is a little crack in the floor. If you jump on top of it it gets bigger. If you do it enough you fall into a small cave where you solve a puzzle / through the planet and land on the other side (instead of walking there)
* A little parkour level with jumps and in which you find out you can crouch. On an otherwise inaccessible platform you find a piece.
